# Phone_Push_Pull_Test


I am testing push and pull file between phone and pc. I want to use it for file tranfer lol 

I need to pull this repo into my phone first. 
Then add some identity, because I can't push without permission to the repo and I can't get the permission without identity

how to set up permission? Git config? 

git config --global.username "SeawaterEtc"
git config --global.email "cholsaseawater@gmail.com"
